Each SymfonyCloud project is billed monthly according to the chosen plan,
except the first seven days of your currently active trial development project.
When you benefit from a free trial, don't forget to accept billing using
``symfony project:billing:accept`` if you want to keep this project after the
end of the free trial, without this confirmation the project will get suspended
then deleted. When you don't use of project anymore, don't forget to
:ref:`delete it <delete-project>` or you will continue to be billed for it.
